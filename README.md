# Cyclistic_Capstone_Project
A Repository for My Final Case Study - Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
The purpose of this repository is for documentation, so I can organize my projects in one place.

Originally, I executed my case study project in Kaggle's Notebook.
The file "cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-2023.ipynb" is the downloaded Kaggle's Notebook in "ipynb" format, but the used programming language is R, not Python.
The file "cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-2023.r" is a linked file from my Kaggle's Notebook.
Both files have the same contents. They also have a different view compared to the Kaggle's Notebook. 

If you are interested, for a better reading experience, I suggest you visit my Notebook through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kurniawanabdurrouf/cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-2023).
